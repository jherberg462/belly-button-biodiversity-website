# Belly Button Biodiversity

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript, and JavaScript libraries Plotly and D3 to create a webpage that presents interactive visualizations of belly button biodiversity data. The data was provided as a JSON array seperate the file containing JavaScript scripts. D3 was used to read in the data into my JavaScript scripts, and Python flask endpoints were used to access the data.

## Analysis Questions

1. What are the demographics of each person whose belly button is sampled? 

2. How frequently does each person wash their belly button? 

3. What are the top ten concentrations of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and their associated OTU for each person?

4. What are all the concentrations of OTUs in each sample?
